This program implements the PERT algorithm. First it finds the topological order of the graph. Within the topologicalOrder method, it determines if the graph is a DAG or not. If it is then it will proceed and use dfs to get the order, else it will terminate. Next in the pert method, this is where we find the earliest completion time of each vertex, latest completion time of a vertex, and the slack of the vertex. The slack will determine if the vertex is critical or not, if it is 0 then it is critical.
